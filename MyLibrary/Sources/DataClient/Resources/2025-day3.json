However, most professional security researchers focus at the low level where app developers don't usually have a lot of knowledge.\n\nThrough my work, I've found quite a few security bugs in Mac and iOS that could be found at the higher level, and those bugs have rewarded me with multiple bug bounty payments from Apple as well as helping improve the security of the operating systems. This talk would be a way to introduce more developers to the practice, with some examples of my past experiences, and encourage them to pursue security research as part of their career. You can read about some of my security research work on my blog.\n\nI think this fits well as both an inspirational and technical topic that's not usually covered in developer conferences.",
