Yet, there exists a niche of individuals who intentionally purchase older digital or film cameras. They are drawn to the unique aesthetic of photos and videos produced by these cameras.\nIn this talk, we'll explore how to achieve such retro-style photos using Swift. While Core Image's documentation offers articles like \"Simulating Scratchy Analog Film,\" implementing these techniques directly into a camera app may not yield the desired retro effect. Therefore, we'll start by reexamining the question, \"What defines a retro-style photo?\" and aim to create the ideal retro aesthetic."

I’ll discuss techniques for automating various aspects of the localization process, including (1) generating screenshots of strings for providing context to translators and validating their translations, (2) generating app store screenshots, including marketing copy in multiple languages, (3) generating meaningful release notes in multiple languages, and (4) verifying app layout and correctness in multiple languages."
