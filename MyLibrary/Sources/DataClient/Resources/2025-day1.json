A takeaway from this equation is the huge number of stars in the universe, which implies a high probability that some of them harbor life. This talk will dive into the details of the equation and then apply it to iOS. Just as the number of stars provide a powerful scale factor, there are technical factors of your app that can multiply your impact. We'll derive a new equation to calculate the carbon footprint of an app, look at iOS memory management to speed up every CPU instruction, and calculate how to reduce bugs all using lessons from the Drake Equation. I will also discuss my own experience building a startup and how I think about the implications of these scale factors when designing developer tools that many large apps will use.",
