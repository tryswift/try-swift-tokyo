          "description": "Immersive Video is a 180-degree video that appears three-dimensional. My team and I, along with several collaborators, captured an Immersive Video of FC Machida Zelvia—a professional soccer team in Japan's J1 League—and hosted a hands-on session exclusively for special members. This project was made possible through the club's support and cooperation. The event was a great success, and we encountered many challenges and learned a great deal through trial and error in the processes of filming, video editing, developing the Swift-based Viewer, and running the session. I'm especially eager to share the in-depth insights we gained from building the Viewer in Swift and the overall experience. It's rare to see professional sports filming projects and Immersive Video technology being showcased at developer conferences, and there are many fascinating insights to be shared from both the video capturing process and the Viewer application development.",
