# LocalizationGenerated

This directory contains auto-generated Swift code from iOS String Catalogs (.xcstrings).

## Generated Files

The following files are automatically generated by the `LocalizationCodegenPlugin` build plugin:

- `ScheduleStrings.swift` - Generated from `ScheduleFeature/Localizable.xcstrings`
- `TrySwiftStrings.swift` - Generated from `trySwiftFeature/Localizable.xcstrings`

## Do Not Edit

**DO NOT manually edit any `.swift` files in this directory.**

All files are regenerated during build time by parsing .xcstrings JSON files.

## Source of Truth

The authoritative source for localization strings is:
- `iOS/Sources/ScheduleFeature/Localizable.xcstrings`
- `iOS/Sources/trySwiftFeature/Localizable.xcstrings`

To update translations, edit the .xcstrings files using Xcode's String Catalog editor or directly as JSON.
